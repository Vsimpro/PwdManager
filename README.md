## Password Manager.
a simple, yet useful password manager to store all of your precious login credentials in one place!
#

#### Usage:
In main menu, you should see the option to select either [R]ead or [W]rite. Choose either by typing the highlited character. Upon your first run, the program should create a new "wallet" that holds your passwords. They are not stored in plaintext, so don't worry (tho I don't imagine they would be super hard to crack, if you read the code ;=) )
